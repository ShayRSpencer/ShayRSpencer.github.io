                            Hello Games Ltd. was founded in 2008 by Sean Murray and Grant Duncan in Guildford, UK. Murray had previously worked at <br> 
                            Electronic Arts, or EA, the company responsible for the Fifa, Madden, and NHL videogame series. Murray and Hello Games <br> 
                            worked on and released <i class="i">Joe Danger</i> in 2010, a platform/racing game for the Play Station 3. The game was <br>
                            met with above-average success, which led to the development of a sequel in 2012. <i class="i">Pictured left is Sean Murray</i><br>
                            <br>
                            In late 2012, Murray had the idea for a science fiction game inspired by scifi media of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Star Wars <br>
                            and Star Trek. The company envisioned a procedurally generated universe, and began work on the game. A trailer was shown <br>
                            at the <i class="i">VGX 2013 Award Show</i>, which generated immense hype for the game. Unfortunatly for No Mans Sky, a flood <br>
                            in their home town two weeks after VGX 2013 destroyed much of the progress which had been made.<br>
                            <br>
                            The studio started from scratch, developing the game over the next two years. Sony had the game formally introduced to <br>
                            millions of potential viewers at E3 2014, the largest electronic exposition in the world. This, with the VGX interview, <br>
                            generated ever-increasing intereset and hype in the game. Unfortunatly for the game studio, the hype and beliefs of <br>
                            what the game will be like rose above the team's ability.<br>

                            Upon release, the game would be what many considered as a "catagorial mess". Bugs (issues) commonplace, the multiplayer <br>
                            not working, the game lacking features etc... The game received horrible reviews upon launch, receiving constant critique <br>
                            and scrutiny. It seemed as if No Man's Sky was just another failure or a scam. However, Hello Games refused to give up on <br>
                            the game. <i class="i">On the left is the E3 Launch Trailer</i><br>

                            Hello Games, realizing constant press interviews led to the immense hype for the game and caused the disappointing release<br>
                            refused to give further information to the press, and secretly began working on updates. Over the next year, thousands of <br>
                            bugs were fixed and features added. By 2017, the Game had begun to reach the initial expectations. By 2019 and 2020, it <br>
                            had surpassed them.<br>
                            <br>
                            Hello Games still works on No Man's Sky, updating the game and adding new features, only publically announcing new updates<br>
                            just before the update is set to go live.<br>
