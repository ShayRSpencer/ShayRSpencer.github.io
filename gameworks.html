        <p style="font-size:13.5px;"><b>The game uses procedural generation to generate the near infinite planets within it. The game has a variety <br>
        of assets it can pick, choose, and mix to make planets, with different colours, atmospheres, and properties. <br>
        A planet can even have a moon or a ring, like our Saturn. However, No Mans Sky does not save each and every <br>
        detail of these planets. Instead, each planet is assigned a "seed", a number which states the information of <br>
        the planet, and any player-made objects on it. Every time a planet is revisited, the game simply recalls the <br>
        seed of this planet. However, this is one of two numbers assigned to a planet<br>
        <br>
        Each NMS planet is also given their own "coordinate", a set of 12 symbols made from an array of glyphs. When <br>
        on a portal, these coordinates function like an IP Address, telling the game which planet to send you to and <br>
        the planet's name.<br>
        <br>
        Once you reach this planet, either by simply landing or by portal, you will be able to explore the life and <br>
        contents of this world. Each NMS Planet can vary between 50 and 250 KM in diameter. A far cry from the planets <br>
        of real life, but very impressive considering there is 18 Quintillion of them. You can explore the seas, collect <br>
        data for the game's in-game currency, or establish a base. Usually, one of the 1-10 Planets found in a star-system <br>
        in NMS will have a surface level trading post, where you can shop for better items.<br>
        <br>
        But there is more to NMS than just planets. The game also allows you to recruit a ship and a crew to travel <br>
        around with you, raid and attack ships with you, or simply help explore. But No Mans Sky is best played with <br>
        your friends, where you can complete tasks and explore a vast galaxy with.<br>
        <br>
        The Game also has a sizeble following on social media, with the aspects of the game allowing for this to <br>
        flourish. People will often share their findings online, like planets, creations, and ships. This community <br>
        allows you to have fun with others in the game if none of your friends are able to play it. <i class="i">An earth<br>

        <br>
        In conclusion, No Mans Sky is not about complete objectives. It is physically impossible to explore every <br>
        world, and the game, perhaps even Humanity, will be long gone before someone can step foot on the final <br>
        unexplored world. But No Mans Sky is more about curiosity, exploration, and friendship, across a simulated <br>
        universe thousands of times smaller than the real one. When I, and most people, play the game, we are <br>
        reminded of the vastness of space, and the infinite complextion it holds. We may never be able to understand <br>
        it all, however that is ok. There is enough for us in our own star system. If you can, I would <br>
        definetly checking out the game for yourself.
